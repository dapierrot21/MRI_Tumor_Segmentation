**MRI Tumor Segmentation Project**

This repository contains the source code and resources for the MRI Tumor Segmentation project. The project aims to develop a machine learning model for segmenting tumors in brain MRI scans, leveraging deep learning techniques. The repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and validation. It serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and applying image processing and deep learning in medical imaging, specifically for tumor identification and analysis in MRI data.

**Key Features:**

- Data preprocessing of MRI images in DICOM format.
- Implementation of deep learning models for accurate tumor segmentation.
- Model evaluation and refinement for improved accuracy.
- Exploration of the integration of imaging and genomic data for comprehensive cancer research insights.
